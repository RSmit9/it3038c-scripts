For my Project 2 assignment I expanded on the budget creator I made for project one. In this Script i catered it more for my personal use, However I simplified the code more to make it easier to use. Also, I imported dattime module to help specify the time im runnign this script. Also, I switched from a weekly budget creatr to a monthly one to help me plan for the month. This budget creator is ment to be ran at the end of the month when you know all of the numbers and the total costs for the month. another big addition to this script is that i have it exporting the relavent information to a text document so that the data can b saved and looked back on to assess my spending habits and possible changed them if need be. 
In the future I would like to export thrse number to an excel file so that i can compare and contrast these number to see how my spending habits changed on a yearly basis and hopefully help me save my money better and more effiecently
