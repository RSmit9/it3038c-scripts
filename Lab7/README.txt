For this Lab i chose the plugin numpy. I have a lot of experience with numpy and using it to caculate complex math problems. Often time i use is to help create arrays in python to do things like creating budgets or caculing materials when working on some projects. I also use it to help caculate tings like the amount of storage somthing will take up or using it to help create various scripts for my co-op. 
 Firstly to install this launch your powershell or linux OS command prompt and install numpy via "pip install numpy" for ps or yum install numpy
 from there you will ne to import the module via import numpy as [name to use for your code]
 after that it is straight forward in using it.
 this is a link to various uses for numpy https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/what-is-numpy-used-for-in-python/
 In the first file(ArrayFunction.py) i just displayed the basic funtions the numpy allows. In numpy you can add arrays in both 1 and 2D as well as manipulating them 
 in the second file(PrimeNumbers.py) it showed how you can utilize the array function to display a list of characters like the prime numbers for example 
 In the third file(ProjectedGrowth.py) there is a script that displays how you could use the array functionality to project possibly growth or use modify it to help budget things
 there are many more powerful things numpy can do like data maipulations tools for machine learning and many more functions.
